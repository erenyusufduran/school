ISO 14001 is for environmental
management.

- This means:
- Minimize harmful effects on the
  environment caused by its activities,
- To conform to applicable regulatory
  requirements, and to
- Achieve continual improvement of its
  environmental performance

ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 are generic
standards.

- Generic means that the same standards can be
  applied:
- to any organization, large or small,
  whatever its product or service,
- In any sector of activity, and
- Whether it is a business enterprise, a public
  administration, or a government department.

ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 both:

- They are not product standards.
- They are not service standards.
- They are process standards.
- They can be used by product manufacturers
  and service providers.
