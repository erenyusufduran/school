<h1> Sensing: Sensors and Transducers </h1>

- A sensor detects changes in the <b> ambient conditions </b> or in the <b>state of another device</b> or a system, and forwards or processes this information in a certain manner.

"A device which detects or measures a phtsical property and records, indicates, or otherwise responds to it."

<h2> Sensors </h2>

- They perform some input functions by sensing or feeling the phtsical changes in characteristics of a system in response to a stimuli.
- For example heat is converted to electrical signals in a temperature sensor, or atmospheric pressure is converted to electrical signals in a barometer.

<h2> Transducers </h2>

- Transducers convert or transduce <b>energy of one kind into another</b>.

- For example, in a sound system, a microphone (input device) converts sound waves into electrical signals for an amplifier to amplify, and a loudspeaker (output device) converts these electrical signals back into sound waves.

<h2> Sensor vs. Transducer </h2>

- The word "Transducer" is the collective term used for both <b>Sensors</b> which can be used to sense a wide range of different energy forms such as movement, electrical signals, radiant energy, thermal or magnetic energy etc., and <b>Actuators</b> which can be used to switch voltages or currents.

<h2> Sensor Features </h2>

- It is only <b>sensitive to the measured property</b> (eg. A temperature sensor senses the ambient temperature of a room.)

- It does not influence the measured property.

<h2> Sensor Resolution </h2>
 
- The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change it can detect in the quantity that it is measuring.

- The resolution of a sensor with a digital output is usually the smallest resolution the digital output it is capable of processing.

- The more is the resolution of a sensor, the more accurate is its precision.

<h2> Sensor Classes </h2>

- BASED ON OUTPUT

        Analog
        Digital

- BASED ON DATA TYPE

        Scalar
        Vector / Multimedia

<h3> Analog Sensors </h3>

- Analog Sensors produce a continuous output signal or voltage which is generally proportional to the quantity being measured.

- Physical quantities such as temperature, speed, pressure, displacement, strain etc. are all analog quantities as they tend to be continuous in nature.

<h3> Digital Sensors </h3>

- Digital Sensors produce discrete digital output signals or voltages that are a digital representation of the quantity being measured.

- Digital sensors produce a binary output signal in the form of logic "1" or a logic "0", ("ON" or "OFF")

<h3> Scalar Sensors </h3>

- Scalar Sensors produce output signal or voltage which is generally proportional to the magnitude of the quantity being measured.

- Physical quantities such as temperature, color, pressure, strain, etc. are all scalar quantities as only their magnitude is sufficient to convey an information.

<h3> Vector Sensors </h3>

- Vector Sensors produce output signal or voltage which is generally proportional to the magnitude, direction, as well as the orientation of the quantity being measured.

- Physical quantities such as sound, image, velocity, acceleration, orientation, etc. are all vector quantities, as only their magnitude is not sufficient to convey the complete information.

<h3> Sensorial Deviations </h3>

Since the range of the output is always limited, the output signal will eventually reach a minimum or maximum, when the measured property exceeds the limits. The full scale range of a sensor defines the <b>maximum and minimum</b> values of the measured property.

- The <b>sensitivity</b> of a sensor under real conditions may differ from the value specified. This is called a sensitivity error.

- If the output signal differs from the correct value by a constant, the sensor has an offset error or bias.

<h3> Non-linearity </h3>

- Nonlinearity is deviation of a sensor's transfer function from a straight line transfer function.

- This is defined by the amount the output differs from ideal TF behaviour over the full range of the sensor, which is denoted as the percentage of the full range.

- Most sensors have linear behaviour

- <b>Noise</b> is a random deviation of the signal that varies in time.

<h3> Hysteresis Error </h3>

- A hysteresis error causes the sensor output value to vary depending on the sensor's previous input values.

- If a sensor's output is different depending on whether a specific input value was reached by increasing or decreasing the input, then the sensor has a hysteresis error.

- The <b>present reading depends on the past input values.</b>

<h3> Other Errors </h3>

- If the senson has a <b>digital output</b>, the output is essentially an approximation of the measured property. This error is also called <b>quantization error</b>.

- If the signal is monitored digitally, the sampling frequency can cause a dynamic error, or if the input variable or added noise changes periodically at a frequency proportional to the multiple of the sampling rate, <b>aliasing errors</b> may occur.

- The sensor may to some extent be <b>sensitive to properties other than the property being meausured.</b>. For example, most sensors are influenced by the temperature of their environment.
